				<h2>Lore</h2>
				<p>As the mountains and the seas have their gods, so too do the stars in the heavens. Greatest of their number is Olorun, God of the Sky and the Heavens, and supreme deity of the Yoruba pantheon. It was Olorun who kindled the spark that would become the sun and, at his command, the Orishas - the Yoruba gods - crafted the world and its inhabitants from the gathered dust of the cosmos.
				<br /><br />
				Although Olorun is the greatest of the Orishas, he seeks no worshippers and ask for no offerings, yet entire nations follow his ideals. Like the stars, he is a remote deity, content to sit in the quiet contemplation of the myriad wonders of creation. And he is powerful enough to ensure the sanctity of his solitude. Olorun commands the fundamental forces of the cosmos - even time itself.
				<br /><br />
				Yet despite this power, Olorun is but one part of a greater whole. A tripartite being, Olorun possesses two other aspects - Olodumare, creator of the universe, and Olofi, the conduit between Earth and the Heavens. As befits a being of such might, Olorun is wise beyond measure, and rarely acts rashly or without some greater purpose in mind. Peaceful by nature, he will nonetheless fight when the need is great.
				<br /><br />
				It is for that very reason that Olorun has chosen to break his long seclusion at last. Despite having held himself apart from the world, he has borne witness to the suffering of mortal and immortal alike. With his far-reaching gaze, he has seen that the thrones of the great pantheons are empty, and that god wars againts god.
				<br /><br />
				In his great wisdom, Olorun has realised that only a king can unite them.
				<br /><br />
				And he will be that king.</p>

				<h2>Abilities</h2>
				<h3>Passive: <span>Touch of Fate</span></h3>
				<p>Upon reaching 150 Magical Power from Items, Olorun gains 15% Critical Hit Chance and a further 1% per 10 Magical Power from Items. Olorunâ€™s Critical hits only deal 50% increased damage. Additionally Olorun gains 5% extra scaling on his basic attacks.</p>
				<p><span>Cap</span>: 70%</p>
				<div class = "divider"></div>
				<h3>1st Ability: <span>Focused Light</span></h3>
				<p>Olorun charges an orb of pure energy for up to 2s. before firing it in front of him. The longer he charges the farther the projectile goes, passing through and damaging Enemy minions but stopping on colliding with Enemy gods. This ability can Critically Hit and can provide stacks of Overflowing Divinity.</p>
				<p><span>Damage</span>: 100/140/180/220/260 (+55% of your Magical Power)</p>
				<p><span>Cost</span>: 50/60/70/80/90 Mana</p>
				<p><span>Cooldown</span>: 12 Seconds</p>
				<div class = "divider"></div>
				<h3>2nd Ability: <span>Overflowing Divinity</span></h3>
				<p>Olorun gains amplified Attack Speed. Every successful attack on an Enemy during the buff provides his inner Sun with energy, to a cap of 20 stacks. During the buff or for 4s after, Olorun can refire this ability to conjure the Sun to damage Enemies in an area. The Sun emits projectiles faster and more randomly with higher ammo. Hitting the same Enemy deals 10% less damage each time, to a minimum of 80% reduction.</p>
				<p><span>Damage</span>: 30/40/50/60/70 (+10% of your Magical Power)</p>
				<p><span>Attack Speed Increase</span>: 40%</p>
				<p><span>Duration</span>: 4/4.5/5/5.5/6 Seconds</p>
				<p><span>Cost</span>: 60/65/70/75/80 Mana</p>
				<p><span>Cooldown</span>: 14 seconds</p>
				<div class = "divider"></div>
				<h3>3rd Ability: <span>Consecration</span></h3>
				<p>Olorun expends the light within himself knocking back and damaging nearby Enemies as well as slowing them for 2s. Allies bathed in the light gain a heal over time that ticks every second for 5s. For every ally healed, Olorun gains Physical and Magical protections.</p>
				<p><span>Damage</span>: 60/80/100/120/140 (+20% of your Magical Power)</p>
				<p><span>Heal Per Tick</span>: 10/15/20/25/30 (+5% of your Magical Power)</p>
				<p><span>Protections</span>: 8/10/12/14/16 Per Ally God Healed</p>
				<p><span>Slow</span>: 20%</p>
				<p><span>Cost</span>: 50/60/70/80/90 Mana</p>
				<p><span>Cooldown</span>: 14 seconds</p>
				<div class = "divider"></div>
				<h3>Ultimate: <span>Sanctified Field</span></h3>
				<p>Olorun brings forth Olodumare and Olofi who travel outwards, creating a large area of divine energy that distorts the flow of time within. All Enemies caught in the area are negatively affected by the time dilation, attacking, casting and even animating more slowly. Olorun himself benefits from the Sanctified Field in a similar way. The strength of the divine field also impacts the effect of buffs, debuffs, projectiles and deployables.</p>
				<p><span>Enemy Debuff</span>: 40% Slower</p>
				<p><span>Self Buff</span>: 30% Faster</p>
				<p><span>Duration</span>: 5 Seconds</p>
				<p><span>Cost</span>: 100 Mana</p>
				<p><span>Cooldown</span>: 140/130/120/110/100</p>
